# README

  Exhibit Philly is designed for exploring museums all over Philadelphia! Users can search for specific museums or look at the list which is populated using the Google Places API. Clicking on the museum presents the user with its details and reviews. Registered users can leave reviews for museums and vote on other users' reviews, with the most popular reviews shown at the top of the list. Other features include e-mail notifications, a user profile page and user account profile pictures. This project has been a collaboration between Brian Karol, Chris Donohue, David MacMurtrie and Joe Tabas.
